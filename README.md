# FleetFlow

An AI-powered, cloud-native delivery and logistics tracking platform built as a
Spring Boot microservices system for CSCI318. See [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) for
the full architecture and hard constraints, and
[`docs/requirements-outline.md`](docs/requirements-outline.md) for the requirements.

## Module map

| Module | Type | Port | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| `order-service` | Service | 8081 | Order lifecycle, cancellation (FR1-FR3) |
| `fleet-service` | Service | 8082 | Courier profiles, availability, capacity, location (FR4-FR6, FR10) |
| `dispatch-service` | Service | 8083 | Courier assignment (agentic + rule-based), reassignment (FR7-FR9) |
| `tracking-service` | Service | 8084 | Location stream processing, ETA, geofencing, risk detection (FR11-FR14) |
| `notification-service` | Service | 8085 | Templated alerts, conversational status explainer (FR15-FR16) |
| `gps-simulator` | External client | — | Posts simulated location pings to Fleet's REST endpoint (FR10) |
| `fleetflow-contracts` | Contract artifact | — | Shared event records (arriving in a follow-up commit) |
| Kafka | Broker | 9092 | Event backbone (no local broker/Docker Compose wired up yet) |

## Structural exceptions

Every service uses the same four-layer package structure
(`api/ → application/ → domain/ → infrastructure/`, see `docs/AGENTS.md`). Two modules
deliberately do not follow it:

- **`gps-simulator`** — it is an external REST client, not a bounded-context service: it
  owns no aggregate, exposes no REST API of its own, and has no direct Kafka access
  (per the locked design decision in `docs/AGENTS.md`). A flat `com.fleetflow.simulator`
  package is the honest structure for that role.
- **`fleetflow-contracts`** (arriving in a follow-up commit) — it is a contract artifact
  shared by the five services, not a service itself, so it has no layers to have.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 21** (Temurin recommended)
- **Apache Maven 3.9+**

Verify your toolchain:

```
java -version
mvn -version
```

## Build and run

Build the whole reactor:

```
mvn clean install
```

Run a single service (each service is independently runnable and owns its own H2
database file under `<service>/data/`):

```
mvn -pl order-service spring-boot:run
```

Kafka is a mandated dependency of the project but no broker or Docker Compose setup
exists yet — that lands in a later commit. Until then, `spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka`
is present on each service's classpath with no bindings configured.
